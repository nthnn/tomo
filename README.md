## Who is Tomo?

> An AI-like handheld interactable full of emotion companion pet made with ESP32 NodeMCU via Arduino Platform.

Tomo is an interactive handheld companion pet crafted using ESP32 NodeMCU and developed on the Arduino platform. This project aims to create a small, emotionally expressive device with a 0.96-inch monochromatic OLED display serving as its facial interface, and a momentary button for user interaction. The name "Tomo" is inspired by the Japanese character "友," which translates to "friend" or "companion," reflecting the nature of this delightful creation.

Tomo embodies the essence of companionship in a compact and accessible form factor, offering users a unique blend of technology and emotional connection. Its minimalist design and intuitive interaction model make it suitable for various applications, from personal entertainment to educational tools.

## Why Tomo?

- **Emotive Expressions**: Tomo boasts a range of facial animations displayed on its 0.96-inch OLED screen, allowing it to convey emotions and engage users in interactive experiences.

- **Interaction**: Users can interact with Tomo through a simple momentary button interface, enabling them to engage with its various expressions and behaviors.
